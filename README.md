# Magazine Purchase Prediction with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and PyQt5 GUI
## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM), to predict magazine purchases. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface developed using PyQt5 for seamless interaction.

## Features
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithm: Utilizes the SVM algorithm for accurate prediction of magazine purchases based on historical data.

PyQt5 GUI: The graphical user interface allows users to input relevant parameters, triggering the machine learning model to predict the likelihood of magazine purchases.

Data Preprocessing: Implements data preprocessing techniques to ensure the model's accuracy and efficiency in predicting magazine purchase outcomes.

Model Evaluation: Utilizes various metrics to evaluate and validate the performance of the SVM model, providing insights into its predictive capabilities.
